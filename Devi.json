          "correctIndex": 3,
          "explanation": "In the SI system, the seven base units are second, meter, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela. All other SI units are known as \"derived units\" because they can be built from these base units. For example, the Gray is a Joule per kilogram where a Joule is given in its base units as kg m²/s²."

          "correctIndex": 2,
          "explanation": "There is a limit to the energy that a charged particle can attain through acceleration in a cyclotron. According to the theory of relativity, as the particle approaches high velocity (in the relativistic range), further acceleration causes the particle to gain mass: m = m₀/√(1−v²/c²). This causes the particle to get out of step with the frequency of the alternating potential applied to the dees. This problem has been solved by using synchrotrons where the frequency of the potential is adjusted to compensate for the increase in mass."

          "correctIndex": 2,
          "explanation": "In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not. That energy is lost to another form. For example, in the photoelectric effect, the energy of the incident photon is transferred to an orbital electron, and that energy is used to overcome the electron's binding energy. Any additional energy beyond the binding energy contributes to the kinetic energy of the liberated electron."

          "correctIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "Filtering a polyenergetic kV X-ray beam will preferentially absorb the lower-energy photons, resulting in a greater average energy and therefore a greater half-value layer. The filter will attenuate the beam, so the intensity will be reduced. The maximum photon energy in the beam and the energy of characteristic X-ray peaks will remain the same."

          "correctIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "The size of the actual focal spot is a function of the size of the filament in the cathode, not the angle of the anode. From the line-focus principle, a smaller anode angle will reduce the size of the effective focal spot. A smaller effective focal spot will produce sharper images. However, a smaller anode angle will result in a greater heel effect (variation in X-ray intensity along the length of the X-ray tube) and will limit the maximum field size."

          "correctIndex": 0,
          "explanation": "The purpose of the oil bath is to absorb heat from the anode in the X-ray tube. Much of the incident electron energy is converted to heat, and this heat is dispersed by utilizing a rotating anode, an angled anode, and an oil bath. Tubes may also be cooled by air or water if oil is not used."

          "correctIndex": 2,
          "explanation": "A monitor chamber is always needed to monitor the dose output. In some linear accelerators, however, different monitor chambers are used for photon and electron beams. The scattering foil spreads the electron beam and makes it uniform in cross-section. The beam current decreases for electron mode as higher electron beam currents are required for X-ray production."

          "correctIndex": 2,
          "explanation": "The thyratron is a gas-filled tube used as a high-power electric switch and controlled rectifier. The switching action can be made very fast, much less than a microsecond. When the thyratron is switched on, it allows large currents from the pulse-forming network to travel through to the pulse transformer and into the klystron."

          "correctIndex": 2,
          "explanation": "Interlocks are hard stops designed to ensure that the linear accelerator will only generate a beam and perform an irradiation if the linear accelerator is in a safe condition and operating as expected. Safety interlocks can include preventing treatment if the vault door is opened or if the linac couch is not locked. Machine operation interlocks can include preventing treatment if the accelerator current is too low or the temperature is too high."

          "explanation": "Bremsstrahlung and characteristic X-rays are produced when the electron beam strikes the target in a linac. Pair production and annihilation radiation may occur when photons interact with matter, but these are not part of the linac output. Compton scattering is an interaction process, not a component of the output."

          "correctIndex": 3,
          "explanation": "The flattening filter is used to make the photon beam intensity uniform across the field by attenuating the central portion of the beam, which is more intense due to the forward-peaked nature of bremsstrahlung."

Some studies have shown the mutation to be present before the patient was treated with these drugs, suggesting exposure to the drug selected for these cells.

Similar patterns were identified in other cancers, such as melanomas, sarcomas, and lung cancers. Based on the large numbers of complex rearrangements in localized regions of single chromosomes, it is hypothesized that chromosomes must be condensed (such as during mitosis) for chromothripsis to occur. Furthermore, the number of copy number states following chromothripsis is predominantly restricted to two, suggestive of these rearrangements taking place over a short period of time in a one-step event. It is estimated that chromothripsis occurs in 2% to 3% of cancers across all subtypes."

An elegant study showed that CTCs can colonize their tumors of origin, modeled with breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma tumors in mice. Tumor-derived cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 act as CTC attractants.

Mice with combined immunodeficiencies in both T cells and NK cells were even more susceptible to cancer development. These findings indicate that, at least in certain experimental models, the innate and adaptive cellular arms of the immune system contribute to tumor immune surveillance and eradication."

          "correctIndex": 3,
          "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Tobacco smoke exposure plays a significant role in the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It has been estimated that tobacco smoking contributes to the development of 20% to 30% of pancreatic cancers. The strongest associations between cigarette smoking and pancreatic cancer have been observed when the smoking occurred within the previous 10 years. Smoking cessation can reduce this risk, returning to baseline risk level 20 years after quitting. Environmental tobacco smoke contains the same toxins, irritants, and carcinogens, such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, cyanide, ammonia, benzene, nitrosamines, vinyl chloride, arsenic, and hydrocarbons, as primary cigarette smoke. Host etiologic factors associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer include a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic cirrhosis, pancreatitis, a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet, and prior cholecystectomy. Although not all studies have supported a relationship between DM and pancreatic cancer, a meta-analysis of 20 epidemiologic studies confirms that the pooled relative risk of pancreatic cancer in persons with DM for 5 years is double (relative risk, 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2–3.2) the risk of persons without DM. Interestingly, the risk of being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is most pronounced within the first 2 to 3 years of the diagnosis of diabetes. This is likely due to diabetes being a paraneoplastic consequence of the cancer. There is no association with a high-protein diet. People of African-American descent experience a higher rate of pancreatic cancer than do those of European ancestry in the United States, with an annual incidence of 16.7 per 100,000 versus 10.9 per 100,000, respectively. Death from pancreatic cancer is similarly elevated, with an annual rate of 14.6 per 100,000 versus 10.6 per 100,000. The diagnosis is slightly, but significantly, earlier in African-Americans compared with Caucasians, with a median age of diagnosis of 68 and 73 years, respectively.

BRCA2 mutations are also associated with pancreatic cancer, particularly in familial cases. These genetic changes are critical in the development and progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Regarding the other options, about 61% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with distant metastases at diagnosis (not 31%), making option A incorrect. Pancreatic cancer incidence increases with age and does not decrease later in life, making option B incorrect.

For T2 gallbladder cancer diagnosed after simple cholecystectomy, extended cholecystectomy is recommended to improve survival. This procedure includes en bloc resection of the gallbladder bed, resection of liver segments IVb and V (to ensure clear margins), and regional lymph node dissection to address potential nodal metastases. Studies show that extended cholecystectomy improves 5-year survival rates to 70% to 90%, compared with 20% to 40.5% for simple cholecystectomy alone. The mild periportal fullness on CT may suggest residual disease or reactive changes, but it does not alter the standard approach for T2 disease. Surveillance alone (option B) is inadequate due to the high risk of recurrence. A second laparotomy for assessment (option C) is unnecessary, as extended resection is the standard.

However, half of the patients with clinically palpable nodes will have inflammatory lesions only. Thus, a course of antibiotics before any further therapy is indicated. If the nodes persist after a course of antibiotics, biopsy and surgical dissection are indicated.

These proteins control cell-cycle progression and apoptosis and have roles in correcting DNA damage and cellular senescence.

Adjuvant high-dose interferon-alfa was used for many years with small benefit. A meta-analysis reported improvements in RFS and OS of <4%. More recently, several prospective randomized trials demonstrated a significant improvement in RFS in patients with stage III melanoma treated with checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF-targeted therapy. Ipilimumab at a high dose (10 mg/kg) showed a significant improvement in RFS and OS in selected patients with stage III melanoma and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Two additional inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, both targeting the PD-1 pathway, were subsequently approved for the same indication in late 2014. A large, randomized phase III study compared the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab to nivolumab alone and ipilimumab alone.

If this woman carries a BRCA1 mutation, her lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 20% to 60%, and her risk of breast cancer is even higher. Although transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 screening are generally recommended for mutation carriers who have their ovaries in place, there is no good evidence that such screening will decrease mortality.

Earlier laparoscopic surgical staging series suggested that up to 30% to 40% of patients thought to have FIGO (The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage I or II disease actually had disease in the upper abdomen. The incidence of extraovarian spread is lower with a grade 1 tumor. Nonetheless, complete surgical staging, if possible, is advised in this case, because the recommendation for a stage IA grade 1 mucinous tumor is no chemotherapy. Although some data have suggested that advanced-stage mucinous tumors may lower response to chemotherapy compared to serous tumors, a low-grade, early-stage mucinous tumor does not have a poor prognosis. However, chemotherapy would be recommended in the case of any extraovarian spread. In the hands of an experienced surgeon, laparoscopic staging, including omentectomy and para-aortic lymph node examination, is an option. Preservation of the uterus and contralateral ovary is reasonable if no further disease is found at the time of staging. CA-125 is frequently normal in women with mucinous ovarian tumors, even when of advanced stage.

Future trials may be able to assess the benefit of transplant in CR1 in higher risk subpopulations of normal cytogenetics (e.g., patients with triple DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, and NPM1 mutations or ASXL1 mutation). Patients aged <55 years who have unfavorable cytogenetics such as -5 and -7 and complex cytogenetics appear to benefit from myeloablative transplantation in CR1. However, older patients tolerate this approach less well, with increased treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Decision-making in older patients must be individualized, and nonmyeloablative transplant approaches are usually preferred."

Even with this strategy, patients at high risk for TLS by virtue of having bulky lymph nodes and high leukemia count must be aggressively hydrated before and during initiation and escalation. According to the package insert, these patients should be hospitalized for therapy initiation and again at first dose escalation."

By current definition, the patient has overt multiple myeloma and will benefit from treatment with an active antimyeloma regimen. This patient did have appropriate imaging workup performed for suspected multiple myeloma according to IMWG consensus, which recommends either low-dose whole-body CT scan or FDG-PET/CT scan initially, and if negative or inconclusive a subsequent axial or whole-body MRI. Fusion PET-MRI is an evolving imaging strategy in multiple myeloma but its role is currently limited to investigational studies. The HevyLite assay is a novel technique of quantifying intact light and heavy chain monoclonal proteins. It measures intact immunoglobulin proteins by measuring unique junctional epitopes between heavy and light chain constant regions. This is particularly useful for IgA monoclonal proteins, which often have limited detection by SPEP, but other roles in multiple myeloma are currently under investigation. NGS to identify genetic mutations reveals the heterogeneous genomic landscape of multiple myeloma pathogenesis.

Kyle et al. described the natural progression of smoldering myeloma in which the cumulative probability of progression in the first 5 years of diagnosis was 51%. The 2018 revised Mayo Clinic risk stratification score, also known as the 20/2/20 score, takes into consideration the risk factors of progression: Bone marrow plasma cells >20%, M-protein >2 g/dL, Involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio >20. Per the current IMWG guidelines, repeat testing is recommended in 2 to 3 months after diagnosis and then monitoring every 4 to 6 months for 1 year. Skeletal surveys are insufficiently sensitive to identify early osteolytic lesions or focal bone marrow involvement. The current IMWG consensus for imaging in the workup of suspected smoldering myeloma recommends low-dose whole-body CT scan initially; if this is inconclusive or negative, a subsequent whole-body MRI is recommended, which, if negative, should be repeated annually. FDG-PET/CT may substitute for whole-body CT scans and MRI if the latter two modalities are unable to be performed. A score of 0, 1, and ≥2 implied low-, intermediate-, and high risk, respectively, with a median time-to-progression (TTP) of 110, 68, and 29 months within the validation cohort. By this definition, the patient in this case has low-risk smoldering myeloma. This scoring system was the basis for analysis in a recent clinical trial in which patients with intermediate- or high-risk smoldering myeloma were randomized to lenalidomide or observation. Three-year PFS was 91% in the lenalidomide arm compared with 66% in the observation arm. An earlier Spanish study evaluated lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) in which high-risk asymptomatic patients saw a PFS and OS benefit with Rd compared to observation, although the risk definitions predated the 2014 revisions to the multiple myeloma definitions. Although such therapy for intermediate- and high-risk smoldering myeloma may be considered, there are no studies to support therapy for low-risk smoldering myeloma."

Integrating these factors, a risk classification system for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma has been developed by the Mayo Clinic, the Mayo Stratification for Myeloma and Risk-adapted Therapy (mSMART) criteria, which divides newly diagnosed patients into risk categories on the basis of cytogenetics, FISH, gene expression profiling (GEP), and plasma cell labeling index studies. High-risk patients are defined by a high-risk GEP signature, FISH studies showing gain of 1q, deletion of 17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), or t(14;20), detection of a p53 mutation, high plasma cell S-phase labeling study, or R-ISS Stage III. Patients who have two high-risk genetic abnormalities are now labeled as having 'double-hit myeloma' and those with three high-risk genetic abnormalities have 'triple-hit myeloma.'

          "explanation": "The initial study evaluating the genomic architecture of multiple myeloma was published in 2011. These findings, which evaluated sequencing of 38 tumor genomes, revealed a lack of consistently conserved mutations among individual multiple myeloma genomes. The most frequent mutations included those in NRAS (9/38) and KRAS (10/38). Frequent mutations were also seen in genes involved in ribonucleic acid (RNA) processing and protein homeostasis, including DIS3, XBP1, LRRK2, and FAM46C. The nuclear factor (NF)-kB pathway is the most frequently affected pathway, with mutations and rearrangements noted in 11 NF-kB pathway genes. Additional mutations were seen in histone-modifying enzymes, including HOXA9. Overall, there are few consistently mutated genes in the multiple myeloma genome, with the most commonly mutated being NRAS and KRAS. This finding has been corroborated by numerous subsequent whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing studies, as well as the prospective CoMMpass registry, in which around 1,000 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma have undergone comprehensive whole-genome, whole-exome, and RNA sequencing. Across these sequencing studies, mutations occur more frequently in noncoding regions of the genome, and whereas many of these mutations are likely passenger mutations, some that disrupt microRNA or small nucleolar RNA likely have regulatory roles that contribute to pathogenesis. Although the IGH locus is commonly associated with translocations that drive oncogenic expression, mutations within that locus have not been described as pathogenic in multiple myeloma. Single-cell sequencing technology allows for more granular dissection of the genomic landscape of multiple myeloma by allowing for clustering of subclones of myeloma cells. A recent single-cell study of myeloma and smoldering myeloma patients described significant intratumoral and intrapatient heterogeneity in both the mutational profile and subclonal makeup of each subject's malignancy, some with a more linear pattern of evolution and others with branching subclonal evolution, failing to describe a common pathway of myeloma cell evolution."

Numerous hematologic malignancies are dependent on BCL-2 overexpression for survival. Venetoclax, a selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of BCL-2, has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in many of these hematologic malignancies. Overexpression of BCL-2 in multiple myeloma is heterogeneous. However, preclinical study of human myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples has demonstrated that those with t(11;14), which occurs in 10% to 20% of patients with multiple myeloma, are associated with significant overexpression of BCL-2 relative to other antiapoptotic proteins. A phase I study of venetoclax, which had a large proportion of patients with t(11;14), demonstrated significant efficacy in patients with t(11;14) with an objective response rate (ORR) of 40%, compared with those lacking that translocation who had an ORR of 6%. These preclinical and early clinical data have spawned numerous clinical trials evaluating venetoclax in various combinations with other antimyeloma therapies, both in a targeted and nontargeted manner. Many of these phase II trials have demonstrated significant efficacy on the basis of response rate. However, an interim analysis of the phase III BELLINI trial, which combines venetoclax with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) versus placebo and Vd, has been highlighted recently due to a safety signal in which an interim analysis demonstrated worse OS for patients in the venetoclax arm, despite significantly improved PFS, the mechanistic cause of which remains unclear. In an underpowered interim subgroup analysis of those with t(11;14), PFS was dramatically improved and there was no difference in OS.

OS results are anticipated. Bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, or VRd, is a reasonable front-line treatment regimen for patients who are not eligible or not planned to go on to immediate ASCT; however, it would not be the best choice for this patient because of his preexisting neuropathy. The SWOG S0777 trial was a phase III trial comparing VRd to Rd, about 6 months of either, in patients who were not intended to undergo immediate ASCT, followed by maintenance lenalidomide and dexamethasone in both groups.

Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor with increased potency relative to bortezomib and comparatively increased efficacy in the relapsed setting. An initial phase I/II trial in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) demonstrated profound initial efficacy with a best overall response rate of 72%, a stringent CR rate of 39%, and 24-month estimated PFS of 92%. This combination is endorsed by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the initial treatment of multiple myeloma. The ongoing phase III FORTE trial has demonstrated deeper responses in patients receiving KRd for 4 cycles followed by ASCT and then KRd consolidation for 4 cycles, or 12 cycles of KRd when compared with patients who received carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (KCd). Triplet regimens containing an immunomodulatory drug are favored over those containing cyclophosphamide on the basis of phase III data that compared bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTd) to bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CVD), with superior overall response. Lenalidomide is often substituted for thalidomide due to decreased rates of peripheral neuropathy, and possibly increased efficacy based on an integrated analysis of multiple trials comparing VTd to VRd. Pomalidomide is currently being studied in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in the relapsed/refractory setting and no data are available for this regimen in the front-line setting. Although triplet therapy regimes are the current standard of care, it is possible that quadruplet regimens incorporating immunotherapy such as daratumumab will become the new standard for transplant-eligible patients. The CASSIOPEIA trial combined daratumumab with VTd to VTd alone in a phase III trial of transplant-eligible patients, with the former associated with improved stringent CR and MRD negativity rates. The ongoing phase II GRIFFIN study comparing daratumumab plus VRd to VRd alone also demonstrated a significant stringent CR improvement with the addition of daratumumab."

          "explanation": "The optimal depth of disease response necessary to proceed with ASCT has been a matter of controversy. Previously, data have suggested that patients with a better pretransplant paraprotein nadir have had improved outcomes. Until recently, prospective data have been lacking. A retrospective study evaluated the outcomes of patients who had achieved less than a partial response to initial treatment for their multiple myeloma. A total of 539 patients were identified who had an ASCT after less than a partial response to initial chemotherapy. Although additional pretransplant chemotherapy resulted in deepening responses in 68% of patients, there was no impact of pretransplant salvage chemotherapy on treatment-related mortality, PFS, or OS. Recently, however, the Myeloma XI trial, a large, randomized, multicenter phase III trial out of the United Kingdom, sought to address, among other questions, whether 'response-adapted' intensification of induction therapy could improve outcomes. Patients received either lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CRD) or thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CTD) as initial induction, four cycles if transplant eligible and six cycles if transplant ineligible. Those who had a suboptimal response (minor response or partial response) were randomized to induction intensification with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CVD) until maximum response or intolerance, or no additional induction therapy. Thereafter, transplant-eligible patients proceeded with ASCT. Of the 289 patients randomized to CVD intensification, 42.6% were upgraded to a VGPR or CR. ASCT improved response rates in both the CVD and no CVD cohorts, although to a greater depth in the CVD cohort (≥ VGPR post-ASCT in 65% vs. 39%, respectively). This translated to a significant difference in the primary endpoint of PFS with a median PFS of 30 months versus 20 months (HR, 0.60; p<0.0001) across all patients and 48 months versus 28 months among transplant-eligible patients (HR, 0.50; p<0.0001). Based on this trial, changing this patient to CVD followed by transplant would be advised to aim to achieve a deeper response because the outcomes were improved compared with proceeding directly with ASCT. Continuation of the initial induction regimen in a patient who appears to have reached a disease plateau is unlikely to provide added benefit. Although the use of a daratumumab-based regimen as salvage therapy could be considered, an ASCT thereafter would still be the best option to provide best outcomes."

Seventy-three percent of the patients received a triple-drug induction regimen, 55% having received RVD and another 14% having received bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CVD). The primary endpoint of 38-month PFS was not statistically different between cohorts, 58.5%, 57.8%, and 53.9%, respectively. There were no significant differences between OS and CR rates either. Tandem ASCT did not improve outcomes in patients with high-risk cytogenetics. There was a higher incidence of infection in the tandem ASCT cohort, but this did not translate to higher treatment-related mortality or worse quality of life. The rate of nonadherence to second intervention in the intensive arms was about 30% in each. The European Myeloma Network 02 trial published phase III trial data suggesting that tandem ASCT provided a PFS and OS benefit to patients.

Numerous regimens have the potential to achieve CRs, although most with such a response will still relapse, implying the sustained presence of malignancy. MRD assays have the ability to detect the presence of disease to a much higher degree of sensitivity. Munshi et al. performed a meta-analysis on 12 trials and identified significantly better outcomes in MRD-negative patients, with PFS overall (HR, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.48; p<0.001) and in studies specifically looking at patients with a CR (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34-0.56; p<0.001). OS was also better in MRD-negative patients overall (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.71; p<0.001) and in CR patients (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.67; p<0.001). These findings were confirmed in a recent large phase III trial (IFM/DFCI 2009) in which MRD negativity measured by both multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) and NGS technologies was highly prognostic of improved PFS and OS, in patients who received lenalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone induction with or without early ASCT. Consensus response criteria, which include assay-specific MRD outcomes in their definitions, have recently been published. Assays available to detect MRD include MFC, NGS, and ASO-qPCR. The MFC and NGS MRD assays are the most commonly used. MFC can detect one malignant clone out of 10^4 to 10^5 cells, and the NGS-based MRD can detect one malignant cell out of 10^5 to 10^6 cells and is generally considered more sensitive. The NGS-based MRD assay tests for the presence of a unique clonotypic immunoglobulin region and requires a sample with myeloma cells present to identify the malignant clonotypic immunoglobulin for comparison. It does not assess a panel of genetic mutations like some commercial myeloid or lymphoid malignancy panels assess, and it does not require confirmation by ASO-qPCR. ASO-qPCR uses PCR primers complementary to the junctional regions of rearranged IGH genes to identify clonality at low levels. However, it is technically demanding as primers adapted to each individual patient are needed for successful qPCR. Although MRD assays allow for deeper response detection, how to utilize MRD to guide therapy decisions is the subject of ongoing clinical trials. Tandem transplantation was demonstrated to not be beneficial in the recent BMT CTN 0702 trial among patients even with less than ideal response, although MRD was not a specific endpoint or hinge-point in this trial."

It was combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in the ELOQUENT-3 trial, a multicenter phase II trial comparing elotuzumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone versus pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and lenalidomide. Elotuzumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone had a median PFS of 10.3 months versus 4.7 months in the control group. Isatuximab is a chimeric CD38-targeting monoclonal antibody that targets a unique epitope of CD38 with a different mechanism of action profile relative to daratumumab, including direct inhibition of the CD38 ectoenzyme. A phase III trial compared isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (IPd) to Pd. Patients were refractory to lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Median PFS was significantly improved in the IPd arm versus Pd, 11.6 months compared with 6.5 months, respectively (p=0.001). There was a trend toward improved OS."

The ENDEAVOR trial was a large phase III comparison of the second-generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone to bortezomib and dexamethasone. Neither arm had lenalidomide. It demonstrated that carfilzomib at a twice-weekly dose of 56 mg/m^2 resulted in a PFS of 18.7 months compared with 9.4 months for bortezomib (1.3 mg/m^2) and dexamethasone. The benefit was seen in both patients who had prior exposure to bortezomib (15.6 months vs. 8.1 months) and no prior bortezomib exposure (not reached vs. 11.2 months). The phase III ARROW trial was a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of different dosing strategies of carfilzomib plus dexamethasone, specifically 70 mg/m^2 once weekly versus 27 mg/m^2 twice weekly of carfilzomib. Neither arm included lenalidomide. Patients included were refractory to their most recent therapy, which included other proteasome inhibitors.

Approval was based on the STORM trial that showed efficacy in penta-refractory patients with an ORR of 25.3%, median time to first response of 4 weeks, and median duration of response of 3.8 months. Median PFS and OS in the entire cohort were 3.7 and 8.6 months, respectively. Selinexor was associated with significant toxicity, including cytopenias, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, weight loss, gastrointestinal toxicity, hyponatremia, and respiratory infections. The STOMP trial (NCT02343042) is currently evaluating selinexor in combination with other myeloma therapies including lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and daratumumab, with encouraging efficacy and possibly improved tolerability due to an attenuated selinexor dosing schedule. Elotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CS-1/SLAMF7 and is approved in combination with an immunomodulatory agent. It is not approved in combination with ixazomib. Second ASCT remains a viable option for patients, generally in those who enjoyed a prolonged relapse-free period who are fit for transplant. Currently, joint guidelines from the IMWG and other blood and marrow transplantation organizations state that high-dose therapy with ASCT is appropriate for any patient who relapsed after primary therapy that included ASCT if the initial remission duration was more than 18 months. The Myeloma X trial compared two cohorts where both received reinduction with bortezomib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone, with one cohort receiving high-dose melphalan and ASCT, the other receiving 12 weeks of oral cyclophosphamide. The ASCT cohort experienced a significant increase in PFS (median PFS 19 months vs. 11 months) and OS (median OS 67 months vs. 52 months).

          "correctIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "BCMA normally functions to maintain the growth and survival of plasma cells. It binds a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) that is secreted from various cells in the microenvironment. Activation by APRIL binding leads to downstream activation of signaling cascades the increase the expression of antiapoptotic proteins and factors that promote survival and metastasis. BCMA is selectively induced during plasma cell differentiation, initially being expressed in postgerminal center B cells with upregulation as this B cell transitions to the plasmablast stage and significantly more so on terminally differentiated long-lived plasma cells. In addition, multiple myeloma cells have been demonstrated to express BCMA at an even higher level than normal plasma cells. BCMA is not involved in normal B-cell homeostasis and is not expressed before B cells transition to the germinal center. This high expression and restriction to mainly myeloma cells, plasma cells, and mature B cells makes an ideal target for immunotherapies with the potential for maximum efficacy with minimal off-target effects. Indeed, BCMA has become one of the preferred targets of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that are currently in clinical development. BCMA-targeting therapies have been initially studied as monotherapy in patients who were heavily pretreated, refractory to proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and often CD38-targeting monoclonal antibodies. Despite refractoriness to these therapies, significant responses have been seen. The ADC belantamab mafodotin recently was reported to have a 31% overall response rate as a single agent in patients refractory to at least one drug from each of those therapeutic classes. In a recent phase I trial evaluating the bb2121 BCMA-targeting CAR-T cell, 55% of patients were refractory to daratumumab. The response rate was over 70% in this population."

Unlike bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid and pamidronate, its use is not contraindicated in patients with significant renal impairment that are not on dialysis. A placebo-controlled randomized noninferiority trial in multiple myeloma patients with bony lytic lesions compared denosumab to zoledronic acid, meeting its endpoint of noninferiority in regard to time to first skeletal-related event. Denosumab was associated with lower incidence of renal toxicity in this trial, 3% versus 7%. In addition, an exploratory PFS analysis suggested that denosumab may confer a PFS benefit relative to zoledronic acid, with median PFS of 46.1 months versus 35.4 months (HR, 0.82; p=0.036).

The diagnostic criteria are: Mandatory major criteria (both required): Polyneuropathy, Monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder (almost always lambda), Other major criteria (one required): Sclerotic bone lesions, Castleman disease, Elevated levels of VEGF, Minor criteria (one required): Organomegaly (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or lymphadenopathy), Extravascular volume overload (edema, pleural effusion, or ascites), Endocrinopathy (adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, gonadal, parathyroid, pancreatic), Skin changes (hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, glomeruloid hemangioma, plethora, acrocyanosis, flushing, white nails), Papilledema, Thrombocytosis/polycythemia.

Plasmapheresis to decrease serum IgM levels and reduce serum viscosity is necessary to reverse the neurologic and ischemic symptoms associated with hyperviscosity syndrome, often needing to be performed before a diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. Even in patients who are significantly anemic, blood transfusions should be avoided if possible as they increase the serum viscosity. Rituximab-based therapies can cause an IgM flare, and plasmapheresis should be considered before such therapy to prevent hyperviscosity syndrome from occurring or being exacerbated in those who have elevated IgM levels at baseline, and patients in the trials of bendamustine/rituximab and ibrutinib/rituximab were permitted to undergo plasmapheresis before initiating therapy. A multicenter phase II study of ibrutinib monotherapy demonstrated an overall response rate of 90.5% in patients with relapsed WM, with a 100% ORR in patients with the MYD88 L265P mutation. In a phase III trial that incorporated patients with both newly diagnosed and relapsed WM, ibrutinib was combined with rituximab and compared with placebo plus rituximab. Ibrutinib plus rituximab had a significantly improved major response rate (72% vs. 32%; p<0.001) and a significantly better PFS (HR, 0.20; p<0.001). Unlike an earlier phase II trial, only the MYD88 L265P mutation was associated with better response rate, with minimal difference across CXCR4 genotypes, and PFS was comparable across all mutational profiles. Eight percent of patients with the ibrutinib plus rituximab combination had IgM flare compared with 47% with rituximab plus placebo, suggesting that ibrutinib can mitigate the flare response. Bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is an active regimen in indolent lymphomas, including WM/LPL. In a phase III trial comparing BR to R-CHOP in indolent lymphoma, of which 41 patients had WM/LPL, the ORR was about 95% and median PFS was 69.5% in BR compared with 28.1% with R-CHOP (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.11-0.64; p=0.0033)."

Stage shift is the diagnosis of a cancer at an earlier stage than would have occurred in the absence of screening. This is necessary but not sufficient for a screening test to be effective in terms of reducing mortality. Survival time after diagnosis can be inflated by lead-time bias. Mortality rates are a better measure of effectiveness."

Urate oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin, which is a more soluble catabolite. This enzyme is present in most mammals but not in humans.

This deficiency is more common in those of African or Mediterranean ancestry. Although the incidence of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is significantly lower with the use of rasburicase in adult patients, this has not consistently been shown for the incidence of clinical TLS. Other than laboratory parameters, outcomes were not significantly different between rasburicase and allopurinol in adults. Importantly, a course of rasburicase is about 15,000 times more expensive than a course of oral allopurinol, and 15 to 20 times more expensive than a course of intravenous allopurinol.

Many patients with TLS develop life-threatening complications, and a quarter of patients die during hospitalization. Among the metabolic complications of TLS, hyperkalemia poses the greatest immediate threat and represents the most important cause of early mortality. Although release of potassium from dying cells is the principal cause of hyperkalemia, falling adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels before cell lysis may lead to potassium leakage. This may explain the initial rise in serum potassium seen in laboratory TLS. Leukostasis, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac arrhythmia are possible causes that are far less likely in this patient.

Hypercalcemia is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome, occurring in up to a third of patients with advanced cancer. Together with hydration, bisphosphonates are the cornerstone of therapy for malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. The bisphosphonate zoledronate is commonly used and produces normalization of serum calcium in 4 to 10 days, with therapeutic duration of 4 to 6 weeks in the majority of patients. Calcitonin can cause rapid decline in serum calcium but is short-acting. Due to risk of tachyphylaxis, calcitonin should not be continued for longer than 72 hours. Calcitonin is appropriate to add to IV hydration and bisphosphonate in the acute setting, given the need for rapid decrease in serum calcium due to symptomatic hypercalcemia. After adequate hydration, 20 to 40 mg of IV furosemide can enhance calcium excretion. However, furosemide is not part of initial management of hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonates inhibit both normal and pathologic bone resorption via direct and indirect effects on osteoclasts. Because the patient is symptomatic and the effect of bisphosphonates may take a few days, he will require an additional short-acting agent."

This syndrome is most often seen following cytotoxic chemotherapy in hematologic malignancies. Incidence of TLS has been reported as high as 42% for patients with high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rapid cell turnover and cell death lead to release of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid, causing hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and secondary hypocalcemia. Uric acid nephropathy occurs when high levels of uric acid deposit in renal tubules, resulting in obstruction and a reduction in glomerular filtration. For prophylaxis, allopurinol is typically started 1 to 2 days prior to induction for adult patients at high risk of TLS. Treatment duration is dependent on ongoing risk. If uric acid becomes elevated despite prophylaxis, it is essential to prevent renal damage by lowering levels. This is best accomplished by rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, which has been shown to be efficacious within hours of administration. Although increasing allopurinol may provide some additional benefit, effects are often delayed 48 to 72 hours.

Options for biopsy include bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or CT-guided biopsy, and there is no evidence to suggest these procedures are unsafe in patient with SVCS. The decision to use radiation or chemotherapy depends on tissue histology. Chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiation is the treatment of choice for SCLC. In NSCLC, radiation has a slightly better efficacy in relieving the obstruction compared to chemotherapy. Invasive procedures such as endovascular stenting or angioplasty are often reserved for patients who are clinically deteriorating and need immediate relief of the obstruction."

          "correctIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "Cauda equina syndrome is characterized by an asymmetric painful lumbosacral polyradiculopathy, a patchy sensory deficit corresponding to multiple lumbar and sacral nerve roots, and bladder and bowel incontinence. In a patient with cancer, this syndrome raises suspicion for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The presence of signs and symptoms referable to intracranial disease such as headache and asymmetric cranial neuropathies facilitates the diagnosis of leptomeningeal involvement. Pain is the most common presenting symptom in patients with MSCC. Neurologic symptoms such as lower extremity weakness and paraplegia typically evolve within weeks to months of the onset of back pain. Few patients experience diminished sensation below the level of compression at presentation. Symptoms of neurogenic bladder dysfunction such as nocturia, hesitancy, and urinary retention may also present. A classic Brown-Sequard syndrome characterized by leg weakness and loss of proprioception on the side of cord infiltration and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side is rarely seen, but incomplete variants exist. Infiltration of the sciatic nerve must be distinguished from malignant epidural compression of a root or the cauda equina. With unilateral involvement, bladder and bowel symptoms are absent."

          "statement": "A 65-year-old female with a 90-pack-year smoking history presents to the emergency room with persistent cough and one episode of mild hemoptysis. Chest radiograph showed a 2.0-cm spiculated mass. Basic metabolic panel is notable only for sodium of 119 mmol/L. The patient appears euvolemic, with normal vital signs and no other significant past medical history. Complete blood count and physical and neurologic examination are unremarkable. Her urine osmolality and urine sodium are elevated. In addition to complete staging imaging and referral for biopsy with interventional radiology, which of the following would you recommend initially?",
          "options": ["Discharge home with oral salt administration and close Na⁺ monitoring", "Admit to hospital for water restriction, IV or oral salt administration, and Na⁺ monitoring", "Admit to hospital and aggressively diuresis with furosemide", "Admit to neurologic intensive care unit (ICU) for 100 mL of 3% NaCl and monitoring"],
          "correctIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "In patients with cancer, hyponatremia secondary to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [SIADH]) occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, or as a complication of therapy. SIADH is often associated with solid tumors of the lung, breast, head, and neck. SIADH is defined as a hypoosmolar or dilutional hyponatremia with excessive natriuresis. This patient presents with asymptomatic, euvolemic hyponatremia, which likely developed over weeks to months, rather than hours to days in the setting of SIADH. The rapidity of correction is guided by clinical presentation and the pace with which the hyponatremia developed. Given this, her sodium correction should proceed over several days. Ideally, she would be managed with judicious water restriction and IV or oral salt administration. Sodium monitoring should be performed regularly. Given she is at normal risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome due to serum sodium concentration >105 mmol/L, no history of alcoholism, advanced liver disease, hypokalemia, or malnutrition, the goal of sodium correction is 4 to 8 mmol/L/day. For the initial treatment of hyponatremia in asymptomatic patients with serum sodium ≤125, which likely developed over weeks, when patient is euvolemic, 20 to 40 mg of furosemide may be considered along with intravenous normal saline. Diuresis alone would not be an appropriate next step in management. Given the need for frequent sodium monitoring, outpatient management is not appropriate. Furthermore, ICU admission for hypertonic saline is not required because the patient is not symptomatic, serum sodium >115 mmol/L, and hyponatremia did not appear to have developed acutely."

          "correctIndex": 3,
          "explanation": "In patients with advanced cancer, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can directly interfere with CSF absorption at the subarachnoid granulations. Under these conditions, the spinal fluid reaches a new equilibrium and gives rise to a condition called normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), with classic radiographic findings, including ventricular enlargement out of proportion to age-related cortical atrophy. These patients often have a triad of clinical findings, including cognitive decline, micturition, and gait apraxia. Patients with cancer are hypercoagulable and are at increased risk for dural venous sinus thrombosis, causing venous outflow obstruction, and 'slit-like' ventricles. Increased CSF production is a rare cause of increased ICP. Lung cancer and melanoma are particularly prone to seed the CNS."

          "correctIndex": 0,
          "explanation": "The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for elevated ICP, likely due to the underlying SCLC. He has acute obstructive hydrocephalus, which constitutes a neurosurgical emergency. In patients with significant symptoms or signs of herniation, placement of an external ventriculostomy will provide immediate relief. Long-term options additionally include placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or placement of a third ventriculostomy. The former is often avoided in the setting of leptomeningeal disease to avoid peritoneal seeding. Both radiation-based therapies and chemotherapy play an important role in the management of SCLC, including those with cerebral brain metastases. Neither, however, would provide the immediate relief needed for this patient. There is no role for embolization-based procedures in acute obstructive hydrocephalus."
