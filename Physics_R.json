    "options": ["Gray", "Joule", "Newton", "Kilogram", "Becquerel"],
    "correctIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "In the SI system, the seven base units are second, meter, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela. All other SI units are known as \"derived units\" because they can be built from these base units.

    "options": ["Charge", "The gap between the two dees", "Variation in mass with velocity", "Potential difference between the dees", "The size of the two dees"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "There is a limit to the energy that a charged particle can attain through acceleration in a cyclotron. According to the theory of relativity, as the particle approaches high velocity (in the relativistic range), further acceleration causes the particle to gain mass: m = m₀/√(1−v²/c²). This causes the particle to get out of step with the frequency of the alternating potential applied to the dees. This problem has been solved by using synchrotrons where the frequency of the potential is adjusted to compensate for the increase in mass."

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not. That energy is lost to another form. For example, in the photoelectric effect, the energy of the incident photon is transferred to an orbital electron, and that energy is used to overcome the electron's binding energy. Any additional energy beyond the binding energy contributes to the kinetic energy of the liberated electron."

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Filtering a polyenergetic kV X-ray beam will preferentially absorb the lower-energy photons, resulting in a greater average energy and therefore a greater half-value layer. The filter will attenuate the beam, so the intensity will be reduced. The maximum photon energy in the beam and the energy of characteristic X-ray peaks will remain the same."

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The size of the actual focal spot is a function of the size of the filament in the cathode, not the angle of the anode. From the line-focus principle, a smaller anode angle will reduce the size of the effective focal spot. A smaller effective focal spot will produce sharper images. However, a smaller anode angle will result in a greater heel effect (variation in X-ray intensity along the length of the X-ray tube) and will limit the maximum field size."

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "The purpose of the oil bath is to absorb heat from the anode in the X-ray tube. Much of the incident electron energy is converted to heat, and this heat is dispersed by utilizing a rotating anode, an angled anode, and an oil bath. Tubes may also be cooled by air or water if oil is not used."

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "A monitor chamber is always needed to monitor the dose output. In some linear accelerators, however, different monitor chambers are used for photon and electron beams. The scattering foil spreads the electron beam and makes it uniform in cross-section. The beam current decreases for electron mode as higher electron beam currents are required for X-ray production."

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Interlocks are hard stops designed to ensure that the linear accelerator will only generate a beam and perform an irradiation if the linear accelerator is in a safe condition and operating as expected. Safety interlocks can include preventing treatment if the vault door is opened or if the linac couch is not locked. Machine operation interlocks can include preventing treatment if the accelerator current is too low or the temperature is too high."

    "options": ["Bremsstrahlung", "Pair production", "Characteristic X-rays", "Annihilation radiation", "Compton scattering"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Bremsstrahlung and characteristic X-rays are produced when the electron beam strikes the target in a linac. Pair production and annihilation radiation may occur when photons interact with matter, but these are not part of the linac output. Compton scattering is an interaction process, not a component of the output."
